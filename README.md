OpenUxAS
========

[![Build Status](https://github.com/afrl-rq/OpenUxAS/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/afrl-rq/OpenUxAS/actions)

UxAS is a collection of modular services that interact via a common message-passing architecture.
Similar in design to Robot Operating System (ROS), each service subscribes to messages in the system and responds to queries.
UxAS uses the open-source library ZeroMQ to connect all services to each other.
The content of each message conforms to the Light-weight Message Control Protocol (LMCP) format.
Software classes providing LMCP message creation, access, and serialization/deserialization are automatically generated from simple XML description documents (see the *LmcpGen* project).
These same XML descriptions detail the exact data fields, units, and default values for each message.
Since all UxAS services communicate with LMCP formatted messages, a developer can quickly determine the input/output data for each service. In a very real sense, the message traffic in the system exposes the interaction of the services that are required to achieve autonomous behavior.

Consider a simple example: the automated construction of the flight pattern to conduct surveillance of geometric lines (e.g. perimeters, roads, coasts).
A “line search task” message describes the line to be imaged and the desired camera angle.
Using this input description, a line search service calculates the appropriate waypoints to achieve the proper view angle.
When the UAV arrives at the first waypoint corresponding to the line search task, the line search service continuously updates the desired camera pointing location to smoothly step the camera along the intended route.

In addition to surveillance pattern automation, UxAS contains services that automate route planning, coordinate behavior among multiple vehicles, connect with external software, validate mission requests, log and diagram message traffic, and optimize task ordering.
In all, UxAS has approximately 30 services.

A core functionality provided by UxAS is the mechanism to calculate near-optimal task allocation across teams of unmanned vehicles.
With a collection of tasks that require servicing and a pool of vehicles available to service those tasks, UxAS is able to determine which vehicle should do which task in the proper order.
This task assignment pipeline is carried out by a series of services working together in a complex sequence.

OpenUxAS is a complex project, so there's a lot to talk about here.
If you want to get started using OpenUxAS as quickly as possible, you can jump to the [quick-start guide](#quick-start).
We've organized this README into sections, to simplify navigation.

*Table of Contents*

1. [Quick Start](#quick-start)
2. [Getting Started](#getting-started)
3. [Building OpenUxAS](#build)
4. [Running the Examples](#examples)
5. [Running the Tests](#tests)
6. [Building the Documentation](#docs)
7. [Adding New Examples](#add-examples)


# 1. Quick Start<a name="quick-start" />

The simplest approach to getting up and running with OpenUxAS is to use [OpenUxAS-bootstrap](https://github.com/afrl-rq/OpenUxAS-bootstrap), a supporting repository that we developed to simplify building, using and developing for OpenUxAS.
A detailed description of what OpenUxAS-bootstrap is and what it provides is available at the [OpenUxAS-bootstrap](https://github.com/afrl-rq/OpenUxAS-bootstrap) repository.

If you prefer to *not* use OpenUxAS bootstrap, you should skip this section and refer to the [next section](#getting-started) instead.

Before you begin, you will need:

1. Ubuntu 20.04
2. curl
3. git
4. python 3.8

Bootstrap your install by running this command:

    ~$ curl -L https://github.com/afrl-rq/OpenUxAS-bootstrap/raw/develop/install/bootstrap | bash

Configure your environment to run the build tool:

    ~$ eval "$( cd ~/bootstrap && install/install-anod-venv --printenv )"

Build OpenUxAS and OpenAMASE:

    ~/bootstrap$ ./anod build uxas
    ~/bootstrap$ ./anod build amase

Now you can run the OpenUxAS examples:

    ~/bootstrap$ ./run-example 02_Example_WaterwaySearch


# 2. Getting Started<a name="getting-started" />

Before you begin, you will need:

1. Ubuntu 20.04 or 18.04
2. git
3. python 3.7 or 3.8

Newer versions of Ubuntu may work, but will not have been tested.
Python is used to provide testing support and to automate the running of examples.

It is possible to build OpenUxAS on Mac, however this is not an explicitly supported configuration.
Likewise, building OpenUxAS on Windows using WSL2 should work, but again, this is not an explicitly supported configuration.

## 2.1. Third-Party Dependencies<a name="dependencies" />

Before building OpenUxAS, you need to make sure you have properly installed the following third-party dependencies.
Please note the version numbers, where listed; more recent versions may work but will not have been tested and should be avoided.

Dependencies required to build OpenUxAS in C++:
* [boost](boost_1_68_0.tar.bz2) 1.68.0
* [czmq](https://github.com/zeromq/czmq.git) 4.0.2
* [cppzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq.git) 4.2.2
* [libzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq.git) 4.3.1
* [pugixml](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml.git) 1.2
* [serial](https://github.com/wjwwood/serial.git) 1.2.1
* [sqlite](sqlite-autoconf-3290000.tar.gz) 3.29.0
* [sqlitecpp](https://github.com/SRombauts/SQLiteCpp.git) 1.3.1
* [zyre](https://github.com/zeromq/zyre.git) 2.0.0

Dependencies required to build OpenUxAS in Ada:
* [libzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq.git) 4.3.1
* [zeromq-Ada](https://github.com/persan/zeromq-Ada.git) (master branch)

Additionally, to build the Ada code, you need an Ada compiler.
The [GNAT Community Edition](https://www.adacore.com/download) provides a free, complete development environment for Ada, including a compiler.

## 2.2. LMCP and OpenAMASE<a name="lmcp" />

The message set used by OpenUxAS is defined using LMCP.
To work with these messages, you need to build [LmcpGen](https://github.com/afrl-rq/LmcpGen) and generate the C++ or Ada message sets.
As part of this process, you will clone [OpenAMASE](https://github.com/afrl-rq/OpenAMASE).

1. Clone [LmcpGen](https://github.com/afrl-rq/LmcpGen).
   Place LmcpGen next to OpenUxAS in your filesystem.

2. Clone [OpenAMASE](https://github.com/afrl-rq/OpenAMASE).
   Place OpenAMASE next to OpenUxAS in your filesystem.

3. Run the python script `resources/RunLmcpGen.py`:
   
        OpenUxAS$ python3 resources/RunLmcpGen.py
   
    This will build the OpenUxAS message sets for C++ and python, build the OpenAMASE message set, and build the documentation for the message sets.

## 3. Building OpenUxAS<a name="build" />

Once you have installed the required third-party dependencies and built the message set, you are ready to build OpenUxAS.

For C++:

    OpenUxAS$ make all

For Ada:

    OpenUxAS/src/ada$ gprbuild -p afrl_ada_dev.gpr


# 4. Running the Examples<a name="examples" />

Once you have successfully built OpenUxAS, you can run examples.

First, you need to put OpenUxAS on your path:

    OpenUxAS$ export PATH=obj/cpp/uxas

The simplest example is the Hello World example.
You can run the Hello World example like this:

    OpenUxAS$ python3 run-example 01_HelloWorld

Before you can run the more interesting examples, you need to make sure [OpenAMASE](https://github.com/afrl-rq/OpenAMASE) is available.
Then, you can run other examples like this:

    OpenUxAS$ python3 run-example 02_Example_WaterwaySearch

You can get a list of available examples by running:

    OpenUxAS$ python3 run-example --list


# 5. Running the Tests<a name="tests" />

Once you have build OpenUxAS, you can run the tests.
Tests are found under the `tests` directory and are language specific.

## 5.1. C++ Tests

The C++ tests are found under `tests/cpp`.
You can run these tests like this:

    OpenUxAS/tests/cpp$ python3 run-tests

If OpenUxAS is built with coverage information, the test suite will report coverage results.

More information about the C++ tests, including how to develop new tests, is provided in `tests/cpp/README.md`.

## 5.2. SPARK Proofs

The SPARK proofs can be replayed and compared to prior results using the script found under `tests/proof`, like this:

    OpenUxAS/tests/proof$ python3 run-proofs


# 6. Building the Documentation<a name="docs" />

There are two parts to the OpenUxAS documentation:
1. a user manual;
2. Doxygen-generated reference documentation for the C++ code.

The user manual is written in LaTeX and requires a full TeX distribution to build.

To simplify building the documentation, we have provided a script in `resources` that will attempt to install needed packages on Ubuntu and then build the documentation.
Run it like this:

    OpenUxAS$ resources/build_documentation.sh

## 6.1 Building the Documentation Manually

If you'd like to do this process manually, then:

1. The User Manual can be generated by running:
   `pdflatex UxAS_UserManual.tex` in the folder `doc/reference/UserManual/`
2. Create HTML Doxygen reference documenation:
   * Open terminal in directory `doc/doxygen`
   * `sh RunDoxygen.sh`
   * In newly created `html` folder, open index.html


# 7. Adding New Examples<a name="add-examples" />

As described [above](#examples), you can easily run OpenUxAS examples using the `run-example` script.
You can also easily add new examples to OpenUxAS that will work with the `run-example` script.

There are three essential parts of an example:

1. the directory that contains the example;
2. the input files that provide example data; and
3. the YAML file that describes the details of how the example should be configured and run.

## 7.1. Creating an Example Directory

The `run-example` script will run examples from anywhere, provided you specify the path to the directory containing one or more examples by using the `--examples-dir` option.
By default, `run-example` looks for examples under the `examples` directory in this repository.
These instructions assume that you will put your new example in the root of `examples`.

The examples provided in the `examples` directory follow a particular naming convention.
While this convention makes finding and referring to examples simpler, it is not required: you may name your example however you like (although the repository maintainers may request that you follow a particular naming convention).

We'll name our new example `20_NewExample`.
Create the directory for the example:

    OpenUxAS$ mkdir examples/20_NewExample

## 7.2. Creating the Input Files

The details of the input files required for OpenUxAS and OpenAMASE are beyond the scope of this README.
The examples included in this repository offer insight and templates that can be copied and specialized for your new example.
You can also find details in the User Manual, which you can build following the instructions [above](#docs).

For the purposes of this README, we will simply copy the files in `02_Example_WaterwaySearch`.
Copy the following to your new example:

* `cfg_WaterwaySearch.xml`
* `Scenario_WaterwaySearch.xml`
* everything under `MessagesToSend`

That is:

    OpenUxAS/examples$ cp 02_Example_WaterwaySearch/cfg_WaterwaySearch.xml 20_NewExample
    OpenUxAS/examples$ cp 02_Example_WaterwaySearch/Scenario_WaterwaySearch.xml 20_NewExample
    OpenUxAS/examples$ cp -R 02_Example_WaterwaySearch/MessagesToSend 20_NewExample

## 7.3. Creating the YAML File

The YAML file, which must be named `config.yaml`, describes the details of how the example should be configured and run.
Continuing the example from the two sections above, the YAML file would have the following contents:

    amase:
        scenario: Scenario_WaterwaySearch.xml

    uxas:
        config: cfg_WaterwaySearch.xml
        rundir: RUNDIR_WaterwaySearch

Broadly, there are two relevant sections to the YAML file:

1. `amase`: an optional section that specifies that OpenAMASE should be run and that provides configuration parameters for OpenAMASE -- if unspecified, OpenAMASE will not be started and any OpenUxAS instances will not be connected to any display (as is the case for the `01_HelloWorld` example); and
2. `uxas` or `uxases`: a required section that specifies that one or more instances of OpenUXAS should be run and that provides configuration parameters for each OpenUxAS instance.

### 7.3.1. OpenAMASE Configuration

If your example requires OpenAMASE, you must provide configuration parameters for OpenAMASE in the `amase` section of the YAML file.
This section is specified as follows:

    amase:
        scenario: <scenario file>
        delay: <delay in ms>

The `scenario` parameter must always be specified and the scenario file must exist.
The scenario file should be an OpenAMASE scenario, as shown above.

The `delay` parameter is optional and is relatively brittle.
If specified, the parameter is the number of milliseconds to wait after OpenAMASE is started before starting any OpenUxAS instances.
You should instead include the `Test_SimulationTime` service in your OpenUxAS configuration so that your OpenUxAS instances will wait for OpenAMASE to start the simulation before starting their timers.
The `cfg_WaterwaySearch.xml` includes this service.

### 7.3.2. Single OpenUxAS Configuration

A single instance of OpenUxAS can be specified using the `uxas` section of the YAML file.
This section is specified as follows:

    uxas:
        config: <configuration file>
        bin: <OpenUxAS binary>
        rundir: <directory for instance outputs>

The `config` parameter must always be specified and the configuration file must exist.
The configuration file should be an OpenUxAS configuration, as shown above.
The path to the configuration file is local to the directory containing the YAML file.

The `bin` parameter is optional.
You should use this parameter if you want to specify that a particular OpenUxAS binary should be used.
This should be the binary filename, not a path.

The expected use case for this parameter is to support running instances of OpenUxAS that are developed in languages other than C++ (which is the default language for OpenUxAS development).
For example, if the Ada (partial) implementation of OpenUxAS should be included in an example, the `bin` parameter would be specified to be the binary built by the Ada build process: `uxas-ada`.
`run-example` will then search for `uxas-ada` on your PATH.

***Note: the `bin` parameter in the YAML file is always followed.***
That is, if a binary is specified in the YAML file, none of the options provided to the user for controlling which binary is used will be respected.
Unless there is a clear reason to specify a binary (as in the example above), it is always better to leave the binary unspecified in the YAML file.
This way, the user has maximum flexibility in selecting the binary they wish for use in the example.

If you do not use this parameter, `run-example` will attempt to find the OpenUxAS binary as follows:

1. based on the command-line option `--uxas-bin` provided to `run-example`;
2. by looking for `OpenUxAS/obj/cpp/uxas`, which is the output of running `make all`;
3. by looking for `uxas` on your PATH.

The `rundir` parameter is also optional.
This is the directory that `run-example` will create and into which OpenUxAS will place files created during runtime, such as the database file containing messages created during execution.
The path for `rundir` is relative to the folder containing the YAML file.
If the `rundir` parameter is not used, `run-example` will create a directory named `RUNDIR` in the directory containing the YAML file.

### 7.3.3. Multiple OpenUxAS Configuration

OpenUxAS is a distributed platform, so we expect that multiple instance of OpenUxAS will be used for many examples.
Multiple instances of OpenUxAS can be specified using the `uxases` section of the YAML file.
The syntax of this section is nearly identical to that describe above:

    uxases:
      - config: <configuration file 1>
        bin: <binary 1>
        rundir: <rundir 1>

      - config: <configuration file n>
        bin: <binary n>
        rundir: <rundir n>

***Note: the `-` in front of `config` is important as is the whitespace/alignment of bin and rundir with config.** This is part of how YAML syntax for lists works.*

You may specify as many instances as you need in this way.

Each configuration file should be distinct, as it will specify the parameters particular to that instance of OpenUxAS.
You should also consider specifying the rundir when using multiple instance of OpenUxAS so that you can be sure to identify which output is associated with which instance.

The example `03_Example_DistributedCooperation` illustrates the use of multiple OpenUxAS instances.
